I don't have any ideas today, so I'm just going to write about my dream last night.

In my dream I was the CEO of a company with hundreds of employees and I was thinking wow, I finally have a job that I really enjoy and the pay isn't bad either. It's hard to remember why I liked it, not sure if it was just the perks, or the freedom to execute my ideas with the resources of a company at my disposal. I only went to the meetings I was interested in, I had assistants to do the stuff I don't enjoy doing. Perhaps what I liked was that every day I had a mostly full schedule (managed by assistants) of mostly interesting activities. My job frequently required getting out of the office and meeting contacts at a variety of locations. Sometimes lunch at a fine dining establishment, sometimes a behind-the-scenes industrial setting of some sort. It required being creative, a lot of reading and writing, connecting people, thinking big. It was weird because being a CEO was never something I aspired to, but if it's really like that then maybe I'll keep it in mind just in case I ever come across a "CEO wanted" sign. Those exist, right?
