I posit that merely consuming art can be a creative act & it flexes the same muscles as those the artist used in creating the work. If the viewer can appreciate what the artist was doing, they become a collaborator in the creation of art. Just as beauty exists in the eye of the beholder, art exists _only_ in the mind of the consumer.

It works like this: The artist creates the work, & the consumer creates the art. Take for example, the novel. The reader adds all sorts of details that are not found in the text. Moreover, the world he adds them to had to be created. The novel's author (a kind of artist) created a version of this world in her mind when writing, but the reader gives birth to his own version with the author as midwife.

Though the novel might be the most obvious example, the same idea can be extended to all art forms. Abstract visual art is fairly obvious. Can we look at it without asking what those colors & shapes represent? The art patron poses the question to themselves & the creative faculties of mind cannot help but come up with answers. These answers, in part or in full, give rise to the patron's appreciation of the art work. And both the questions & answers are creative since they are spontaneously generated from each viewer's unique life experiences.

Representative visual art is not excluded. Take a courtly painting of some unknown madam or gentleman. We inevitably make up a story about who this person was & this story contributes to our enjoyment. But then there's also the subtlety of the brushwork, & anyone who has ever tried to paint anything before knows how difficult that is & can _imagine_ the years of tireless practice that led to the artist's mastery. Having insight in to the hard work that went in to a work, in my experience, leads to a deeper appreciation of the work.

[This could be the seed for a proper, longer essay. I want to also cover movies and TV shows since we're consuming a lot of those these days and those are works of art too!]

So anyone who says they're not creative, just go consume some art & I think you'll find you're more creative than you thought!
