Enough to keep us very busy every day, including weekends, until the first event launches in early January.

Perhaps that’s because those areas of the brain that I use when programming get all the exercise and the rest kinda goes to sleep, then when I’m doing other things like talking to human beings it takes a bit for them to wake up.</p>\n<p>It’s funny how deadlines work. They’re always stressful. A little stress inspires, but <em>too</em> much and I find myself getting anxious. Anxiety leads to more mistakes and myopic choices which make meeting the deadline harder. This is one of the latter sort of deadline, but I also know that being anxious is a choice, even if it’s hard to resist sometimes. So I’m fighting a battle on two fronts. One, completing the work itself. Two, resisting the thoughts about the work that create anxiety.</p>\n<p>All that is to say, to those who know me, I may need your understanding and patience for a time (or more than usual.) In exchange I’ll be the best friend, family member and human being I know how to be.</p>',excerpt:"If I seem flakey or unresponsive in the recent past or in the next couple months, it’s because we ( EventRay ) have an important deadline to meet.
