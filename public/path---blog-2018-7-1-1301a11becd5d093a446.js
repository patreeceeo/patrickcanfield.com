It’s not for anyone but myself, and if anyone else reads it, great. The idea is to be “process oriented” rather than results oriented, to practice getting thoughts out of my head and into words.

I believe in the idea, which is echoed by Seth and many others, that the best way to have ideas is to write, and write a lot.
