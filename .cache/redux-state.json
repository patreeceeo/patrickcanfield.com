Went running on the trails there one morning and saw a giant buck.\n\nIt dawned on me that Atlanta has a November Project tribe, and that I could make their Wednesday morning workout before my flight home so I booked a hotel near Ponce City Market, where the workout would be held. I set my alarm before going to bed, then I woke up and saw 6:22 on my clock, eight minutes before the start! I never sleep through my alarm. I leapt out of bed, got dressed, ran outside and started booking it. Now, it was a special workout in that everyone was encouraged to bring a few cans of food for a local charity. So there I was, running pell-mell in the early morning twilight, carrying my four cans of Green Giant. I get to the meeting spot expecting to see a big crowd. No one. A minute later I see a couple guys running, so I hazard to guess they're also looking for the workout. Turns out they are, and they're somewhat familiar with the area, so after a bit of wandering around we come to a park and see some people running with cans. Success!\n\nThe workout was designed to incorporate the cans: running with one can in each hand, doing lunges while shoulder pressing the cans, you get it... During the workout I got my shirt \"tagged\"<sup>2</sup> with the Atlanta tribe's decal: ATL inscribed in a peach, then afterwards got some coffee with the friendly leaders of the Atlanta tribe and another visitor from Austin, Texas. Then I booked it back to the hotel to get ready for my flight.\n\n![NP ATL](npatlgroup.jpg) _The workout crew_\n![leaders, the traveller and me](npatlleaders.jpg) _Myself, two of the leaders and the visitor from Austin_\n\n****\n\n<small>footnotes</small>\n\n##\n\n1. <small>\nFirst place we went to was a korean/southern bar-b-que fusion joint. We later decided that didn't really count and went to a place called D.B.A. in Virginia Highlands.\n</small>\n2. <small>\nSpray-painted. It's like a wearable passport book!\n</small>\n",

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nThe whole EventRay team, all three of us, got together in Atlanta this past week for a coding \"sprint.\" It was pretty successful on all fronts: We accomplished five weeks of work, ate real bar-b-que<sup>1</sup>, chicken and waffles, and saw Marietta's giant animatronic chicken.\n\n![big chicken](bigchicken2.jpg) _It's trying to eat me!_\n![doing work](cafesanfrancisco.jpg) _Working from Cafe San Francisco (in Atlanta)_\n\nWe stayed at a place near Chattahoochee River National Park, so I got to check another national park off my list. Went running on the trails there one morning and saw a giant buck.\n\nIt dawned on me that Atlanta has a November Project tribe, and that I could make their Wednesday morning workout before my flight home so I booked a hotel near Ponce City Market, where the workout would be held. I set my alarm before going to bed, then I woke up and saw 6:22 on my clock, eight minutes before the start! I never sleep through my alarm. I leapt out of bed, got dressed, ran outside and started booking it. Now, it was a special workout in that everyone was encouraged to bring a few cans of food for a local charity. So there I was, running pell-mell in the early morning twilight, carrying my four cans of Green Giant. I get to the meeting spot expecting to see a big crowd. No one. A minute later I see a couple guys running, so I hazard to guess they're also looking for the workout. Turns out they are, and they're somewhat familiar with the area, so after a bit of wandering around we come to a park and see some people running with cans. Success!\n\nThe workout was designed to incorporate the cans: running with one can in each hand, doing lunges while shoulder pressing the cans, you get it... During the workout I got my shirt \"tagged\"<sup>2</sup> with the Atlanta tribe's decal: ATL inscribed in a peach, then afterwards got some coffee with the friendly leaders of the Atlanta tribe and another visitor from Austin, Texas. Then I booked it back to the hotel to get ready for my flight.\n\n![NP ATL](npatlgroup.jpg) _The workout crew_\n![leaders, the traveller and me](npatlleaders.jpg) _Myself, two of the leaders and the visitor from Austin_\n\n****\n\n<small>footnotes</small>\n\n##\n\n1. <small>\nFirst place we went to was a korean/southern bar-b-que fusion joint. We later decided that didn't really count and went to a place called D.B.A. in Virginia Highlands.\n</small>\n2. <small>\nSpray-painted. It's like a wearable passport book!\n</small>\n",

Mine has longish brown hair that weaves its way down to just above the scarf wrapped jauntily around his nape, a knowing smile and a few more years than myself. Ken’s his name.\n\nThere’s people delivering on foot, and bicyclists like Ken and myself. We’re the last to get to the burrito supply, and what’s left seems so puny in comparison with our massive carrying capacity that Ken decides to go sweet talk someone at the end of the assembly line. He returns victorious, with a full box of hot foil-wrapped love capsules.\n\nWe get rolling as the sun is setting. Ken leading the way, we cross the rush hour traffic on Potrero Avenue more daringly than I would have on my own. We’re heading to the “hairball”, the intersection of Cesar Chavez and Bayshore Freeway, where homeless encampments clog the pedestrian pathways.\n\n“How long have you lived here?” Ken inquires, once we’re safely in the southbound bike lane. San Francisco is constantly reinventing itself, and you can infer, or assume, a lot about a person by what stage of the evolution welcomed them.\n\n“Four years” I said. Turns out he’s resided here eight times longer than that, as long as I’ve been alive. And that he has to be more careful on his bike these days because the city has become so congested with street traffic.\n\n“And what brought you here?” I tell him about visiting San Francisco on a trip while in college and felt an affinity to the place. Years later, after leaving a job, it seemed like as good a time as any to make the move. He’s glad to hear that people continue to move here out of a love of place. I don’t say that in that first several months I had a lot of mixed feelings, that the grime and stress and overwhelm drove me away. But the city had gotten into my bones, the way wild yeast gets in to sourdough, and I came running back. This place inspires me to make great art, write poems, and attempt other things I can’t do. I didn’t share any of this, but the important thing, a shared love, had been recognized.\n\nWhen it comes to Ken’s story, the cover did not mislead. He left New Jersey with Hollywood aspirations, took a detour through San Francisco and didn’t make it to Los Angeles until twenty years later. He now makes [documentary films about mental health from a perspective known as radical psychology](http://www.kenpaulrosenthal.com). Rather than pathologize emotional distress, the radical mental health movement considers madness largely as a reflection of a social condition, he explained. He also works as an Arts and Exhibition Preparator in a workshop for adults with developmental disabilities called, [Creativity Explored](http://www.creativityexplored.org).\n\nWe arrive at the hairball to find that the people living there had been “resolved” by SFPD, something a majority of legal residents voted in favor of but probably wouldn't carry out themselves. As it turns out, there’s still a few of them huddled together in a cove created by the transportation infrastructure. You might think they looked threatening if you were just passing through in the shadowy night, but up close, with faces lit up by some foil-wrapped nourishment, I can’t help but feel some kinship. We rode on and pretty soon I spotted a tent by the athletic fields.\n\nLately I’ve been taking pains to be more aware of my surroundings, to see what’s actually there rather than what I’ve been conditioned to see by past experiences, to relish and be grateful for all that I have. Altruistic actions like Burrito Project are a good opportunity for that. Improving the powers of perception improves creativity as well as the ability to perform magic, the real kind. It’s part of a thesis I’ve been meditating on lately, the coalescence of a diverse bibliography: The Artist's Way, Bacteria to Bach and Back, Siddhartha etc. I believe I'm not alone in my need for this kind of magic.\n\n“Hot burritos! Anyone in there hungry?” I say in the most non-threatening voice I could muster. A man's head emerges, there's a woman behind him.\n\n“What is this? Oh my gawd yes!” I hand them both burritos.\n\n“And what do you do?” Ken asks once we’re rolling again. I feel apprehensive. Seems there’s a severe allergy to technology professions that afflicts a lot of non-tech people in San Francisco, and not without reason. I guess it was thanks to our common appreciation for San Francisco that he didn’t write me off when I told him that I’m part of an internet startup. I could tell from his questions that he’s definitely outside the tech bubble, and probably doesn’t even watch Silicon Valley.\n\n“But” I say, “I’m going to leave soon. I just can’t bring myself to focus on it anymore. I still like coding,” I explain, “but my ideal arrangement wouldn’t have me doing it full-time. I —“\n\n“I sense there’s a dream percolating there.” I’m glad for the interruption. I needed a second to gather my thoughts. Actually, I’m still meditating on that one. He’s right, though.\n\n“I’ve always had an artistic side.” I said, starting with what I’m most certain about. Ken was audibly pleased with that answer.\n\n“I have a theory that the weather and landscape here fosters creativity. The weather is so strange and unpredictable, creating a sense of instability, which the hills and mountains contribute to…” We dismount as we approach another tent.\n\n“It keeps things from getting routine.” I offer. I read somewhere that one of the necessary conditions for creativity is just enough random noise in the environment that helps the creative generate ideas, but not so much that they can’t actually get any work done.\n\nWe come across several people living by the factory at 16th and Van Ness. One of them wants two burritos, then another, then another. He says they’re for so-and-so. Then he wants two more for some other buddies. We give them to him, asking him to just not let them go to waste.\n\nThe next group we come across seems to have re-created a living room on the sidewalk by a boarded-up building. They’re wishy washy about the offer of burritos. One of them asks if they’re vegetarian.\n\n“Yep!” I said.\n\n“Well I’m a meat eater. No thanks.” The others seem to follow his lead.\n\nWe get back to Martin de Porres as the operation is shutting down. Ken goes to give some feedback to the coordinators about how to better handle the migrations of the homeless population. I get talking to someone else who says we gave out 530 burritos.\n\nIt’s curious how sometimes you’re looking for something, and then when you’re not, it appears. During the ride Ken was telling me about how there’s still a thriving arts community here, despite the rampant gentrification. As we're saying goodbye I ask Ken about his latest film [Whisper Rapture](http://www.whisperrapture.com), a music and mental health doc-opera about cellist-vocalist, [Bonfire Madigan Shive](http://bonfiremadigan.com/) and he informs me of a lot of other interesting things to check out, such as [a meditation society founded by x-punk rockers](https://www.againstthestream.org/centers/san-francisco/), and [how to be privy to local artists’ open studios](https://www.artspan.org/events-programs/visit-sf-open-studios). I haven’t quite figured out what I want to be when I grow up, but I at least have some things I’m excited to explore.\n\nOn my ride to Burrito Project I noticed a van on the side of the road by a discount grocery store. It was advertising tamales, $2 each. Now that all the burritos are gone, I need to feed myself, so I track down that van. It seems like a husband and wife team. Strong Latin American accents, but I can understand just fine. I get the impression they don’t see many customers who look like me. I order one pork and one beef. They were delicious.\n\n\n",

Loved getting to see so much Northern California beauty on a bike, with no concerns and nothing to do but mash pedals and goof around, plus there's a nice high you get from biking 50+ miles. It also makes me sleep like a baby. No, a rock. ...a little baby rock. Can't wait for the next multi-day bike adventure, TBD.\n\n* * *\n\n<span class=\"dropcap\">M</span>y cousin, Tom, and I spent our Thanksgiving weekend on a little three day adventure by bicycle, and it was better than sweet potato casserole <small>[or insert your favorite Thanksgiving dish here]</small>, and I love to eat. This cousin went by himself on a two day bike trip to Santa Cruz a few weeks earlier and crashed on my couch the night before. I was on the verge of dropping everything just to go with him, but I made an agreement with him and myself that we would go at the next opportunity, which turned out to be Thanksgiving.\n\nThat Tuesday we meet a Finnegan's Wake to hash out the details. The plan still feels hazy when I leave, but we at least had decided to start Thursday morning from Tom's place in Berkeley and ride north, winding through wine country, then at some point veer west and meet up with the Pacific Coast Highway which would bring us to San Francisco on Saturday. I would crash on his couch the night before this time. As for sleeping the other nights, we decided to defer booking hotels and bring our camping stuff, so in the worst case we can find a secluded patch of forest to call home for a night. Having that option in our back pockets gives us flexibility with limited downside, but at the cost of carrying that extra stuff.\n\nI load up on shelf-stable foodstuffs from Trader Joe's and buy some [pannier bags](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JUGTX62/ref=TE_tex_dp_1) online to carry them and my camping stuff. A little anxious about the possibility of finding myself in the middle of nowhere with no snacks, though in retrospect its obvious the chances of that happening are slim to none. But, like I said, I really like to eat.\n\nWe leave Thursday morning and rode north, just like we planned. The first several miles through Berkeley, El Cerrito, etc I'm ecstatic with anticipation for the adventures ahead. But the weight of doubt and of my pack hits me along with the first hill. All the stuff I'm carrying makes hills significantly more difficult to ascend. I fear winding up on the side of some massive hill, unable to pedal another foot, whereupon I suddenly, and with a loud thud, fall on my side. That never happens, as it turns out. I eat some of my snacks, my pack becomes lighter and I have more energy. A win-win-win solution!\n\nAside for a brief grind along highway 29 through American Canyon, the first morning is pleasant and peaceful.\n\n\"B****TCH!\" Someone has decided to share his feelings with me and has leaned out of a window to shout them. I'm in such a good mood that I just smile back. I register some dismay on his face just before he withdraws, as if that wasn't the reaction he was looking for.\n\nWhile eating lunch in Napa, we decide to veer west a bit early and head towards Santa Rosa, where, through the wonders of the internet, we discover a hotel with vacancy.\n\nWe rode through Sonoma, ravaged by the recent fires. Saw remains of houses with little more than a chimney to mark the ground somone once called home. A spray-painted sign hung on the fence around one such ruin reads \"Still thankful.\" We conclude the night with massive burritos and beers at a restuarant across the street from the hotel. I'm exhausted, but in a euphoric way.\n\nThe next morning we set out while the chilly fog yet hung about, lending a certain shadowy mystique to the agricultural landscape. Its just farmland and forests, hills and valleys, all the way to the costal highway. Cows and sheep are our only spectators today. There were a few hills that almost broke us, psychologically. It just made the view at the top all the more wonderous.\n\nWe arrive at to Point Reyes Station, and though there's still a few hours of daylight left, decide to hunker down there for the night. Having neglected to do so earlier, we pull out our smartphones to figure out where exactly that would be. It was looking bleak there for a bit, if you can call having to camp in the woods bleak. But we found a vacancy at a wonderful little [bed and breakfast with a hottub](http://www.abaloneinn.com/), and surprisingly affordable. Sold! I could have slept on the park bench I was so zonked.\n\nThe next morning we ride down to Stinson Beach, where we eat lunch. Tom's knees are bothering him, so we decide to \"ride\" to the top of Mount Tamalpais via bus. The bus arrives with one bike already on the rack. There's only space for two. Maybe that bike's owner is getting off, we hope. It becomes obvious that only one of us is getting on the bus, so I tell Tom to go ahead and I'll meet him up there. Little did I know that the ride to the summit is at least an hour and a half long! I knew it would be a slog, but not such a long one. I tried my darnedest to catch up with him, but by the time I was half way up the mountain he had already waited for a while and rode on to Sausilito, several miles from the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nUp to this point the trip had been perfect, I can't imagine it going any better. If I could do it again I would skip the summit and instead ride to Sausilito to meet up with Tom so we could ride across the bridge and finish the ride together. I never ended up catching up with him, he was exhausted and wanted to go home. I did make it to the top of Mount Tamalpais, so I was rewared with an expansive view of the bay area, but I think the sense of accomplishment from us riding across the bridge together would have been greater. I tend to either try for too much, or nothing at all.\n\nI find my way down Mount Tamalpais, which turns out to be its own challenge. The most direct route to Sausilito is a mountain bike trail. I'm a bit trepidatious about taking it with my bike weighed down, but take it anyway since I'm still thinking I could meet up with Tom. Also the sun is setting. I'm pleased to find everything, bike and body, still in one peice when I finally reach pavement. Then I just ride home, feeling bummed about the failed rendevious as I cross the bridge alone, but I'm simultaneously full of thanksgiving for having enjoyed such a great adventure.\n",

I'm posting this a month after the fact because I wanted to finish this thing I made to accompany this blog post. Been putting in a couple hours a day a few days a week. What is it? A box that shows photos (which I took with my phone) and places them on a map using the data embedded in the digital file format (EXIF). Now that I've got this I want to start using it in more posts that weave together photos, reflections and specific locations in San Francisco and perhaps beyond. And perhaps make other cool map things.\n\n\nAnyway, about my field trip. There's this organization called ArtSpan which does a lot to nourish and promote the (visual) arts community here in San Francisco. One of those things is a program called Art in Neighborhoods, which showcases pieces by local artists in hotel lobbies, cafes and such. I happened to notice it while browsing ArtSpan's [website](https://www.artspan.org/home) and decided to go see how many of the pieces I could see myself. I felt a little self-conscious walking in to lobbies of hotels that I wasn't checked in to, but I strode in like I belonged there. I regarded it as an exercise in acting cool and seemly. The hotel staff probably didn't care anyway. And hypothetically I could have been there to purchase some art, I thought as I sipped iced lemon water and stared at the stormy composition by Anna-Lena Sauer.\n\nMy adventure took me around a central neighborhood known as the Tenderloin, (in)famous for great food and cultural attractions juxtaposed to extremely visible homelessness and drug abuse. There was one location, an actual art gallery, CounterPulse, where it seemed to be closed contrary to information online and I didn't bother investigating much because the scene outside was a bit too raw and I was too uncomfortable. I guess I was just afraid of being singled out by one of those people who suffer from delusions and verbal outbursts. Otherwise I had a pleasant time walking from spot to spot, enjoying the ubiquitous murals so I was practically swimming in art.\n\n",

I’d been fighting this war for over two years and every night felt like a new battle. Daily exercise helped a lot, but it seemed like I needed eight hours of exercise to buy eight solid hours of sleep. For a while I thought coffee was the enemy, but I love coffee and cutting it out didn’t consistently help. I made sure my room was dark and quiet but I’d still wake up in the middle of the night in fight-or-flight response. In retrospect, it seems obvious that meditation would be a promising solution-space. I realized that the problem was all in my mind. It was a habit of thought, which doesn’t make it any less of a real problem. I had such high expectations for myself every day that being delayed or inconvenienced for just a few seconds from the pursuit of my objectives felt like an impending personal doom. I strained my mind to figure out how to squeeze every ounce of productivity out of each day. This idea of hyper-productivity sort of took on a life of its own as an overbearing task-master, who would flip on the internal fluorescent lights and sound the alarm when I needed to be sleeping.\n\nBeing randomly invited on a meditation retreat in the Santa Cruz mountains was what clued me in. As I hinted at earlier, ideas are sort of alive. They’re also contagious. I had tried meditation before, but it never really stuck. It just felt like I was wasting time. In Santa Cruz, though, I was surrounded by people who \"got\" it and was immersed in their ideas about meditation and saw first hand that it’s not just a thing you do for a bit in the morning in the privacy of your bedroom, but a way of life. And I saw that it could be a lot of fun. And then I “got” it. I no longer saw meditation as something I *should* do, but something I *get* to do. I don’t really understand how, but I feel like it’s more effective now. Now, after meditating, I feel like everything is quieter, slower, simpler, and more enjoyable. Since then I’ve done more research on my own and found that a blend of mindfulness meditation and compassion meditation for about 15 minutes to be hugely effective for me.\n\nLife rarely lets you change one variable at a time, though. Soon after the meditation retreat the startup I’m a part of started seeing some payoffs for our months of hard work, and I had enjoyed increased peace of mind concerning paying my bills. Without this peace of mind I may not have applied what I learned from the retreat as much as I have. Now that I have, though, I feel like I have the tools to prevent insomnia from become a big issue again. It didn’t start with the startup, and there will always be struggle and stress in life.\n\nI recently splurged on an iPad Pro because of the ease with which it lets me make art. I’ve found that it’s also arguably a kind of meditation. After using it I find that I’m more perceptive. I spend a lot of time writing computer code these days, which leaves me thinking and feeling more computer-like: differences below a certain threshold do not make a difference to me. But in the practice of making art, though, every detail in the subject is potentially important, and you have to train your mind to actually see those details. After drawing for a while I’m seeing the world as an artist, noticing things in my every day environment that I hadn’t noted before and seeing beauty everywhere. It doesn’t seem to matter that I’m making art with a computer. I guess the resolution is high enough and the inputs sensitive enough that to my brain it’s just like analog mediums. Also, it’s known that imagination and perception use the same circuitry in the brain, and learning to see as an artist again has helped me steal back control of that circuitry from an over-active imagination.\n\nThis one is dedicated to my Uncle’s mother, who I’ve had the pleasure of meeting at two weddings in the past couple of years, and her family.

Publishing a blog at a website named after yourself? Adding to the ever-growing ocean of information whatever commonplace thought crosses your mind? For whom? Who cares? Why?\n\nYou're looking at it all wrong. It's not for anyone but myself, and if anyone else reads it, great. The idea is to be \"process oriented\" rather than results oriented, to practice getting thoughts out of my head and into words. If the results are not remarkable, that's fine, but the possibility that they might be, eventually, provides a little extra motivation.\n\nInspired by [this podcast episode from Seth Godin](https://www.akimbo.me/blog/season-2-episode-1-permission-and-seo-and-blogs) I'm going to try to write something, no matter how inspired or smart I feel, every day. Because I like ideas. I like other people's ideas, but only consuming other people's ideas gets old after a while. I believe in the idea, which is echoed by Seth and many others, that the best way to have ideas is to write, and write a lot. Though originality is a fuzzy notion, I feel confident in saying this particular post has zero original ideas, but if I keep restating unoriginal ideas long enough, eventually whether by accident or insight I'll say something sort of novel.\n",

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nWhat hubris. Publishing a blog at a website named after yourself? Adding to the ever-growing ocean of information whatever commonplace thought crosses your mind? For whom? Who cares? Why?\n\nYou're looking at it all wrong. It's not for anyone but myself, and if anyone else reads it, great. The idea is to be \"process oriented\" rather than results oriented, to practice getting thoughts out of my head and into words. If the results are not remarkable, that's fine, but the possibility that they might be, eventually, provides a little extra motivation.\n\nInspired by [this podcast episode from Seth Godin](https://www.akimbo.me/blog/season-2-episode-1-permission-and-seo-and-blogs) I'm going to try to write something, no matter how inspired or smart I feel, every day. Because I like ideas. I like other people's ideas, but only consuming other people's ideas gets old after a while. I believe in the idea, which is echoed by Seth and many others, that the best way to have ideas is to write, and write a lot. Though originality is a fuzzy notion, I feel confident in saying this particular post has zero original ideas, but if I keep restating unoriginal ideas long enough, eventually whether by accident or insight I'll say something sort of novel.\n",

Since my last entry I started and finished a contract job. It wasn't the kind of work that I really want to do, but I learned a lot (mainly about the nature of contract work) and was compensated well enough that I have time to figure out my next steps. What did I learn? For one, it's hard to help people who don't know what they want. The end-client was a startup who's CEO just couldn't commit to a design, and kept asking for changes mid-implementation. I got better at anticipating possible design changes and writing code that minimizes the difficulty of making such changes. I also learned the value of managers, of which there were none on this project. If there was a manager, she would have established norms that maximize productivity. For example, when you have a non-urgent work request, you put it in some kind of shared tracking system. Preferably, there is only one such system that everyone uses. What you _don't_ do is go drop by the desk of the person who you think is right for the job and interrupt whatever task he's currently working on. Such an asynchronous process is more efficient because task switching is hard. It's hard on the mind of a programmer who needs to hold of lot of information in his working memory, information that's different from one task to another. My client had multiple systems for tracking work, and they still did the dreaded drop-bys. A programmer's nightmare.\n\nNot that I was perfect. If I were to do it all over again I would have taken more care with my initial time estimate. They presented me with complete \"pixel perfect\" designs for the entire website. They told me they needed it in a month. I looked it over for about 10 minutes and told them I could do it. Two months later, and with one additional contractor on the job, it was finally mostly done. Though the water is muddied a bit by the design changes (see above paragraph) I was wildly optimistic in my initial estimate. If I find myself in such a situation again I would spend a whole day analyzing the design, sort of implementing it in my head, to arrive at a more accurate estimate.\n\nI guess because the project was so behind schedule, the client was threatening to not pay me for half of the work I did for them. Thankfully, just today, before writing this, I received half of that withheld half, and it looks like I will get the other quarter of the total soon enough. It's a weight lifted off my shoulders. Still, I didn't go to the beginning painting class I enrolled in for the summer at the city college today because I was sure the client wouldn't pay me and consequently I would have to scramble to find another job. I was already falling behind in the painting class, and I think missing today just put the nail in the coffin. I think I prefer digital painting anyway. I realized that painting with real paint required a lot of technical knowledge about pigments, substrates, brushes etc but I just want to make images. There's a parallel to my day job. Creating software also requires a lot of technical knowledge. There are substrates to know about like hardware platforms, software platforms. There are brushes like compilers, IDEs. There are pigments like programming languages, techniques, paradigms... So far no one has managed to create software that allows a designer to create software without technical knowledge, but when it comes to painting I have my iPad Pro + Pencil which allows me create while being blissfully unaware of the underlying complexity.\n\nI'm thinking my next step is a lateral move in to video game development. It's what got me interested in programming in the first place. My young imagination was sparked playing games like Super Mario, Pokemon, and a slew of titles for MS-DOS and Windows (Anyone remember Grim Fandango?) As a super geeky middle schooler I taught myself BASIC and ActionScript and struggled to wrap my mind around C++. There are a plethora of game development shops here in San Francisco, from the massive public companies like Disney/LucasArts to tiny indie game firms. Just today I was talking to an acquaintance who, as it turns about, spent eight years in the game industry. He offered to connect me with people who might be hiring, so I'm about to drop him a line. Anyway, that's my game plan, and a bad plan is better than no plan.\n\nP.S. I wasn't sure how to work this in to the above, but I've been posting my art to my Instagram and thinking of it as my online portfolio.

He's busy painting the wooden frames white and scraping the excess off the edges of the glass. The other introduces herself as Amy. Bean Bag was nice enough to let them work on their stretch of sidewalk. She explains that Chris paints on the reverse side of the glass, requiring him to think in reverse. On ordinary substrates like canvas you start by painting the background and work your way forward, but when painting on the back of glass you start with the foreground. They're preparing some pieces that they hope will be selected for the new Transbay Terminal. There's some kind of event where artists bring pieces before the people who get to decide this kind of thing. I hope they get some works in there. Window panes salvaged from old Victorian houses would be a great juxtaposition to the sleek modern transit terminal and a nice homage to a symbol of old San Francisco.\n\nHere's a video about Chris Duke by the San Francisco Chronicle:\n\n<iframe height=\"432\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uyba6zFCYDM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",
